          Since October 2021, in my role as a senior front-end developer at
          Elegant Seagulls, I develop custom WordPress themes using Advanced
          Custom Fields (ACF) and PHP, enhancing website functionality and user
          experience. I build landing pages with Next.js and Contentful,
          optimizing site performance and engagement. I also lead accessibility
          remediation projects for major SaaS companies, improving compliance
          with WCAG standards.
